## Dataset Overview

```{python,  label= dataset-summary,message =false,echo= false }
data.describe()
data.shape
```

This dataset — BMW Worldwide Sales Records (2010–2024) — contains over 50,000 records of BMW’s sales and specifications across multiple regions. Key features include: Model, Year, Engine_Size_L, Transmission, Fuel_Type, Color, Region, Price, and Sales_Volume. This dataset was chosen because it provides a diverse range of attributes for exploring market behavior, pricing trends, and customer preferences in the automotive industry.

## Questions

1.  What are the key factors influencing BMW used-car prices in the market?
2.  Can machine learning models accurately predict used-car prices?
3.  How stable are these predictions over time?
4.  Using a temporal split, how well can the model predict pricing trends for “next year”?

## Analysis Plan

1.  Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handle missing values

Standardize numerical units

Encode categorical variables

Ensure time-related variables are aligned for temporal analysis

2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Price trends by year, region, and model

Correlation analysis between price and vehicle attributes

Identify patterns that may indicate shifting market preferences

3.  Modeling Approach

Apply Machine Learning Models:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regression

Random Forest Regression

Evaluate using:

RMSE, MAE, R²

Perform:

Feature importance analysis

Temporal train–test split to simulate predicting next-year price trends

4.  Visualization Dashboard

Build clear, interactive visualizations using matplotlib / seaborn

Include:

Price distribution

Trend lines across years

Model performance summary

Visualization Dashboard:

-   Build clear, interactive plots for trends and insights using matplotlib and seaborn.
